# 📊 Socioeconomic Status Inference from Social Media

This repository presents an NLP-based pipeline for estimating the socioeconomic status (SES) of social media users through occupation inference from their self-written profile descriptions.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Millions of users publish their bios on social media without structured occupational or demographic information. We aim to infer:
- Occupation (via keyword matching)
- ISEI socioeconomic score (1–100)
- SES class (Low / Middle / High)
- Country (from fuzzy location matching)

---

## 🧠 Methodology

1. **Regex + Keyword Matching**  
   - English & Turkish occupation terms  
   - Hierarchical dictionaries (category → job title → keywords)

2. **ISEI Score Assignment**  
   - Based on Ganzeboom et al. (1992)  
   - Extended for modern jobs (e.g., Data Scientist, Blockchain Expert)

3. **SES Classification**  
   - High SES: ISEI ≥ 75  
   - Middle SES: 65 ≤ ISEI < 75  
   - Low SES: ISEI < 65

4. **Country Detection**  
   - Handles free-text city/region names like “Kartal”, “Istanbul/Çengelköy”  
   - Uses city-to-country dictionaries & fuzzy logic
